# ShellStorm Python Script - README

## Description

This Python script, called "shellstorm," is a command-line utility for searching, viewing, and extracting shellcodes from the ShellStorm database. ShellStorm is a well-known online repository of shellcodes, which are small code snippets used for exploiting software vulnerabilities.

The script interacts with the ShellStorm API to search for shellcodes based on provided keywords and display the search results in a tabular format. Users can then select a specific shellcode by its ID and choose to download it as raw shellcode bytes or write it to a file.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following requirements met:

1. Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
2. The 'requests' library for making HTTP requests. You can install it using `pip3 install requests`.
3. The 'terminaltables' library for creating tabular output. You can install it using `pip3 install terminaltables`.
4. The 'huepy' library for colorful output. You can install it using `pip3 install huepy`.

## Usage

To use the script, follow the steps below:

1. Clone or download the script to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.

Run the script with the following command:

```
python3 shellstorm.py [KEYWORDS] [-w FILENAME] [-x]
```

Replace `[KEYWORDS]` with the keywords you want to use for searching shellcodes. You can provide multiple keywords separated by spaces. For example:

```
python3 shellstorm.py linux x86 execve
```

### Optional Flags

- `-w FILENAME` or `--write FILENAME`: Write the selected shellcode to a file with the specified filename. For example:

  ```
  python3 shellstorm.py linux x86 execve -w my_shellcode.txt
  ```

- `-x` or `--extract`: Extract raw shellcode bytes only, without displaying additional information in the output. For example:

  ```
  python3 shellstorm.py linux x86 execve -x
  ```

If you want to download a specific shellcode directly by its ID, simply pass the ID as the only argument:

```
python3 shellstorm.py 12345
```

## Output

The script will retrieve the search results from the ShellStorm API and display them in a tabular format. The table will include information about each shellcode, such as the title, platform, ID, author, and URL.

You will be prompted to enter the ID of the shellcode you wish to download or view. The selected shellcode will be displayed on the screen, and if the `-w` flag is used, it will be written to the specified file.

## Example

```
python3 shellstorm.py windows x86 messagebox -w my_shellcode.txt -x
```

In this example, the script will search for shellcodes with the keywords "windows," "x86," and "messagebox." It will then display the search results in a table and prompt you to enter the ID of the desired shellcode. The selected shellcode will be extracted as raw bytes and written to a file named "my_shellcode.txt."

## Note

- Please ensure that you use this script responsibly and only on systems you have explicit permission to test.

- The script relies on the availability of the ShellStorm API. If the API becomes unavailable or its URL changes, the script might not function correctly.

- If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to submit them to the script's GitHub repository.
