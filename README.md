# PhishFinity : Phishing tool


The various folders contain the scripts of the phishing pages of the same site as the folder name. 
All those folders need to be kept together in a parent folder, and that parent folder should be along with the file, phishfinity.sh, which will be controlling the phishimng pages.

All of these are for educational purposes only. 

These two commands need to be run on the terminal, to install the dependencies.


=> -v curl > /dev/null 2>&1 || { echo >&2 "I require curl but it's not installed. Install it. Aborting."; exit 1;

=> -v php > /dev/null 2>&1 || { echo >&2 "I require php but it's not installed. Install it. Aborting."; exit 1; 

Thank You.
